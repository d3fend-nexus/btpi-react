# BTPI-REACT Deployment Troubleshooting Fix Summary
# Resolves Cassandra corruption and Wazuh restart loop issues

echo "🔧 DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING FIX SUMMARY"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""
echo "✅ ISSUES RESOLVED:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🗄️ CASSANDRA DATABASE CORRUPTION"
echo "   - Root cause: Deployment script always destroyed existing containers"
echo "   - Fix: Modified services/cassandra/deploy.sh to preserve healthy containers"
echo "   - Result: No more SSTable corruption from repeated container recreation"
echo ""
echo "2. 🔄 WAZUH INDEXER RESTART LOOPS"
echo "   - Root cause: Deployment script always destroyed existing containers"
echo "   - Fix: Modified services/wazuh-indexer/deploy.sh to preserve healthy containers"
echo "   - Result: Eliminates unnecessary restart cycles"
echo ""
echo "3. 📊 STATUS RECOGNITION PROBLEMS"
echo "   - Root cause: Health checks used wrong ports and lacked authentication"
echo "   - Fix: Updated fresh-btpi-react.sh health check logic"
echo "   - Result: Proper service recognition and intelligent deployment decisions"
echo ""
echo "🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo ""
echo "• services/cassandra/deploy.sh:"
echo "  - Added existing container detection and health validation"
echo "  - Intelligent restart logic instead of destroy/recreate"
echo "  - Enhanced CQL connection testing with retries"
echo ""
echo "• services/wazuh-indexer/deploy.sh:"
echo "  - Added existing container detection and health validation"
echo "  - Proper port mapping (9400) for health checks"
echo "  - Intelligent restart logic instead of destroy/recreate"
echo ""
echo "• deployment/fresh-btpi-react.sh:"
echo "  - Enhanced Cassandra health check with retries and internal port validation"
echo "  - Fixed Wazuh indexer port mapping (9201 → 9400)"
echo "  - Improved health check logging and error handling"
echo "  - Added bypass logic for problematic services during deployment"
echo ""
echo "🎯 BENEFITS:"
echo ""
echo "✅ Data persistence - No more database corruption from container recreation"
echo "✅ Faster deployments - Skip recreation of healthy containers"
echo "✅ Better reliability - Intelligent service state detection"
echo "✅ Reduced resource usage - Avoid unnecessary container churn"
echo "✅ Improved logging - Better visibility into deployment decisions"
echo ""
echo "📋 VERIFICATION COMPLETED:"
echo ""
echo "• Cassandra deployment script tested - ✅ Preserves existing containers"
echo "• Wazuh indexer deployment script tested - ✅ Preserves existing containers"
echo "• Health check functions updated - ✅ Proper authentication and port usage"
echo "• Status recognition improved - ✅ Eliminates false negatives"
echo ""
echo "🚀 DEPLOYMENT RELIABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED!"
